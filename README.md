# CS-330
Corusework from CS330 section (SEP-OCT 2025)

The included files showcase the skills I learned during my time in CS-330
I followed object oriented building to complete this project in a timely manner.
This project allowed me to develop better time management skills to be able to build projects more efficiently.

I approach developing programs, in this case with given codespaces by our professor, reading through the cide to see what is going on behind the scenes. This helped me to improve my programming skills by having a better understanding of the project before diving deep into it.
